Hello and thanks a lot for downloading my hud.		==============================
													feshud v0.6.8 [October 15th, 2022]
													==============================	
* Make sure to save a copy of the Hud before you customize it!

=====================
'--- Installation---'
				
				* Unzip feshud-master.zip (use winRAR or 7zip) 
				
				Now should you have:
				
				feshud-master
				├── 4x3
				└── 16x9
				 
				Open one of these folders relying on your aspect ratio!
				
				> Example < [16x9: 1920x1080 or 1280x720] [4x3: 1280x1024 or 1280x960]


				
				*** Do NOT put the 4x3 folder or 16x9 folder in your custom folder as the Hud wont work this way! ***
				
				
				* Put the Hud into your 'custom' folder and ensure that the final file structure should resembles the following:

				\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\
				
				tf
				└── custom
					└── feshudv0.6.8
						├── materials
						├── resource
						├── scripts
						├── sound
						└── info.vdf

				Recommended resolution on 4x3 is 1280x960. Some things might be out of position on other 4x3 resolutions
				Recommended resolution on 16x9 is 1920x1080. Some things might be out of position on other 16x9 resolutions
===============
'--- Fonts ---'

				Install every font used by the hud to make sure that the hud will be working correctly. (Select all and rightclick to install)
				Fonts are located here: 

				feshudv0.6.8
				└── resource
					└── fonts

				* The in-game font might not being displayed correctly if you don't do this!
